`corpkit` is still missing documentation. For now, when things go wrong, you can select `Help` &rarr; `Save log` to generate a log file for your session. You can send this to developers to help diagnose the source of a problem.

## Settings

You can use `File` &rarr; `Save project settings` to save some settings of your project,. These will be loaded when you open the project in the future.

## Updates

If you're connected to the web when you open `corpkit`, it will look for software updates, and prompt you to download them if available. Major changes will be explicated when this occurs. You can also check for updates manually via the menu bar.
