I'm Daniel McDonald, a PhD student in linguistics at University of Melbourne/PolyU, Hong Kong.

I made *corpkit* because there was no reusable way of doing the kinds of interrogations I needed for my thesis and other research projects. I suppose basically, the research question underlying `corpkit` is:

> What might non-computational linguists want to do with parser output?

I made a basic command line interface for interrogating, editing and plotting corpora, and presented it alongside research project findings. Colleagues seemed interested in some of the methods, but didn't know how to program, so I'm putting the GUI and documentation together mostly for them.
