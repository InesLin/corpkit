> `Visualise` is all about representing your results graphically. You should be able to generate publication-quality figures without needing to export the data from the tool.

Most options here are self-explanatory. Pick the results you want to plot, play with some options, and hit `Plot`. This can be a great way to identify salient linguistic features in your dataset. Once you've plotted something, a navigation pane appears under the figure, allowing scrolling, zooming, saving and so forth.

Note that `Number to plot` takes the top `n` entries from the results of interest. If you don't want these, go back to the `Edit` tab and remove/sort the results some more. You can type in `all` to get every result---but be warned, this often won't look so good!

> More documentation forthcoming

## TeX 

Checking the `TeX` option will mean that the plotter will try to use `LaTeX` to typeset the text in the chart. If you have a TeX distribution, but this option isn't working for you, you may need to use the command-line version of `corpkit`.

## Visualising data with other tools

If you're more confortable generating visualisations in another tool, you can head to the `Manage` tab to export a CSV version of any interrogations or edited results. This can be imported into Excel, for example.

## Next steps

Through the process of interrogating, editing and visualising, you may find something that sticks out: maybe something is very frequent in a subcorpus, or maybe something is conspicuously absent. The `Concordance` tab allows you to resuse your `Interrogate` queries to look at language in co(n)text.
