Everything about `corpkit` is free and open-source. If you can code, please do consider contributing to the [GitHub](https://www.github.com/interrogator/corpkit), by way of issue, fork or pull request.

Be warned: some of the code dates back from my very early days as a programmer, and as such is really pretty tough to work with. Documentation is lacking, but it's in development. The GUI resides in `corpkit/corpkit-GUI.py`, though that also suffers from being a very poorly organised bit of code.
