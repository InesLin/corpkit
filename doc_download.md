Currently, *corpkit* works for Mac, and probably Linux. Windows support is coming soon. Click the button below to get the latest version:

<td align="center" valign="bottom">
<a href="https://github.com/interrogator/corpkit-app/raw/master/corpkit-2.0.8.tar.gz"><i class="fa fa-download fa-5x"></i></a>
</td>
</center>
<br>

Alternatively, you could head to [**GitHub**](https://github.com/interrogator/corpkit-app) and click `Download Zip`. Unzip that file, as well as the `.tar.gz` file inside that.

See the [Setup page](doc_setup.html) for (very simple) installation instructions.
