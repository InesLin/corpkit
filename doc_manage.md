> `Manage` allows you to manipulate your interrogations, edited data and stored concordances.

When you open a project, `corpkit` will load up any saved interrogations and concordances. You can do this manually with the `Get saved interrogations` and `Get saved concordances` buttons.

Saved data will be highlighted in green. If you have unsaved interrogations or concordances, they will appear highlighted in red.

For both interrogations and concordances, you can use the `Manage` tab export to CSV, remove from memory, or save or delete from your hard drive.

If you select an interrogation and hit `View`, you can see all the options used to generate the result. Queries will appear below, in case you'd like to copy and paste them.

> This level of interrogation management ensures that anything you uncover during your investigation can be reproduced by yourself, and by others. In fact, you could send your project directory to someone else, and they could open it with `corpkit` and quickly manipulate your results.
