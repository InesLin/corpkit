Accessing
--------------------

With corpkit installed, you can start the interpreter in a couple of ways:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ corpkit
   # or
   $ python -m corpkit.env


Objects
---------------------

The interpreter has a few objects you can work with.


Commands 
-----------

You do things to the objects via commands.



Switching to IPython
---------------------

When the interpreter constrains you, you can switch to IPython with `ipython`. Your objects are available there under the same name. When you're done there, do `quit` to return to the *corpkit* interpreter.
