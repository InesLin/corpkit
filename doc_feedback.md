*corpkit* is a new tool, with a small user base, and an even smaller list of developers. As such, things are bound to go wrong, and there are potentially useful features that nobody has even considered adding yet.

The absolute best way to report bugs, request features, or document how you're using the tool is via the [*GitHub Issues page*](https://github.com/interrogator/corpkit/issues). If you don't have a GitHub account, do consider signing up just for the purposes of creating an *Issue*.

*Issues* make it possible for other users to see what has been reported and requested, as well as whether or not the problem has been fixed, or the enhancement added. For developers, Issues provide a map of what users want and need.

For less formal requests, there is also a [*Gitter* chat room](https://gitter.im/interrogator/corpkit). Feel free to ask questions or give comments there, too.
