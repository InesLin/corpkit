## Unidentified developer message

If you can't open *corpkit* because it is from an unidentified developer, simply `control-click` or `right-click` it and select open that way. There's a little more information about this weirdness on the [Apple website](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH14369?locale=en_US).

## Log

`corpkit` hasn't been around long, so it's quite possible that something will break from time to time. Most of the time, when this happens, you should see some kind of error in the status bar. You can also select `Help` &rarr; `Save log` to generate a log file for your session. You can send this to developers to help diagnose the source of a problem.

## Updates

If you're connected to the web when you open `corpkit`, it will look for software updates, and prompt you to download them if available. You can also check for updates manually via the menu bar. This behaviour can be disabled via `Menu` &rarr; `Preferences`.
