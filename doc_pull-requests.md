Everything about `corpkit` is free and open-source. If you can code, please do consider contributing to the [GitHub](https://www.github.com/interrogator/corpkit), by way of issue, fork or pull request. Nothing stops you from forking the GitHub Pages branch and adding some extra documentation, either!

Most of the current bugs will be for the GUI, which whose code resides in [`corpkit/corpkit-GUI.py`](https://github.com/interrogator/corpkit/blob/master/corpkit/corpkit-gui.py). New releases of the *corpkit* app automatically copy this version of the code to the [*corpkit-app* submodule](https://github.com/interrogator/corpkit-app), so don't bother editing any of the code found there.
