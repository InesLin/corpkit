About
====================

I'm Daniel McDonald (`@interro_gator <https://twitter.com/interro_gator>`_), a linguistics PhD student and Research Fellow at University of Melbourne, though currently visiting Saarland Uni, Germany. *corpkit* grew organically out of the code I had developed to make sense of the data I encountered in my research projects. I made a basic command line interface for interrogating, editing and plotting corpora, which eventually turned into a GUI and this fancy class-based Python module. Pull requests are more than welcome!
