I'm Daniel McDonald, a PhD student in linguistics at University of Melbourne/PolyU, Hong Kong. Most of my research revolves around looking for lexicogrammatical and discourse-semantic patterns and changes in large datasets. 

*corpkit* grew organically out of the code I had developed to make sense of my data. I initially made a basic command line interface for interrogating, editing and plotting corpora, and described it alongside my research project findings whenver I presented my research. Many people seemed interested in some of tools and methods, but most didn't know how to program. So, for them, I'm putting together this graphical interface, documentation.

The best way to look at *corpkit* is as an rickety little open-source bridge between applied, systemic, corpus and computational linguistics.
