Currently, *corpkit* works for Mac, and presumably Linux. Windows support is coming soon.

To download, head to [**GitHub**](https://github.com/interrogator/corpkit-app) and click `Download Zip`. Unzip that file, as well as the `.tar.gz` file inside that.

See the [Setup page](doc_setup.html) for (very simple) installation instructions.
