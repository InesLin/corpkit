> `Manage` allows you to manipulate your interrogations, edited data and stored concordances.

With `Get saved interrogations`, you can load into memory any findings you saved in the project earlier. `Get saved concordances` does the same with previously saved concordance lines. These are performed automatically when you open a project with saved data.

For both interrogations and concordances, you can then export to CSV, remove from memory, or save or delete from your hard drive.

If you select an interrogation and hit `View`, you can see all the options used to generate the result.
