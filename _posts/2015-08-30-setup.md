## Installation

Currently, `corpkit` can be installed on OSX, with a Windows release scheduled for the near future.

The easiest way to get the software up and runnning is to head [https://github.com/interrogator/corpkit](here), and do `Download Zip`. Extract that folder, and then the `corpkit-v-vv.tar.gz` file within that. In there is `corpkit-v-vv.app`, the OSX application. Move it into your Applications directory if you like.

Once you've installed `corpkit`, you can delete the zip files you originally downloaded to save space.

> If you want to use `corpkit` to parse files, you'll also need *Stanford CoreNLP*. The first time you try to parse files, `corpkit` will help you get the  parser installed. 

Now, just open the app to begin!
